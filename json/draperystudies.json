This is clearly evident in the lower part of the sheet in his use of black and white chalks to emphasize areas of light and shadow. The basket and the little table visible on the lower right of the painting had probably not been addressed at this stage. \u00a9 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett \/ J\u00f6rg P.

It is also tempting to assume that a clothed male model was used due to the omission of the breast in the sketch. However, this conclusion cannot be firmly established as the figure of the Virgin is partly covered by the position of Christ in the finished painting. The pose of the Virgin\u2019s left arm with the long folding drapery of the sleeve differs from the one in \u2018The Madonna of the Cat ('La Madonna del Gatto')\u2019. Barocci might have carried out this drawing quite early on in the preparatory stages and he may also have used some of these studies in other compositions. \u00a9 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett \/ Volker-H.

The Virgin is suckling the Child and Saint Joseph looks on from the right.\nNG 29 may be the picture painted, according to Bellori (1672), for Count Antonio Brancaleoni, who lived near Perugia. The design was engraved in reverse in 1577 by Cornelius Cort and the painting probably dates from about 1575. Numerous drawings made in preparation for NG 29 are known; a highly finished drawing made by Barocci in preparation for the engraving and formerly in the National Gallery is now in the British Museum.\nThe window and the bench in the background seem to be based on windows in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino.
