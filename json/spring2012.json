Red lake pigments, especially those based on insect dyestuffs, often contain phosphorus. This could contribute to the apparent concentration in the glass, especially where the particles are small.<br\/>f. The binding medium of many of these paintings has been analysed by Gas Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry and identified as a drying oil. These analyses have generally been published in past issues of the National Gallery Technical Bulletin.<br\/>g. In this sample the glass particles are very small and are embedded in a matrix of red lake, with a substrate containing alumina. The interaction volume of the electron beam is likely to be larger than the glass particle and the apparent aluminium concentration too high.<br\/>h. The quantitative results quoted are from a particle in the priming layer, which does not contain red lake, or from a large particle in red lake paint; the high reported Al content is therefore reliable.<br\/>i. A dispersion of a paint sample allowed individual glass particles to be seen in transmitted light under the microscope. They could be seen to have angular edges and showed conchoidal fracture, confirming that they were glass, despite the rather low alkali content seen by EDX analysis, which is a result of severe leaching.
