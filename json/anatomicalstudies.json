KdZ 20518 (4244), Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett) Barocci is a celebrated animal painter. After having studied the anatomy of Saint John the Baptist\u2019s right arm in this rather damaged sheet, he focuses on the saint\u2019s hand holding the animated goldfinch. He depicts the bird in detail and experiments with the pose of its head and its legs. The bird\u2019s form and placement are a primary concern for him, but he is also exploring how to create the dynamism revealed in the saint\u2019s arm holding the restless goldfinch, which is shown ready to retreat after the cat\u2019s imminent pounce. \u00a9 Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett \/ Volker-H.

It is hard to establish at what stage in the artist\u2019s compositional process it was carried out. The child\u2019s left foot is omitted in the painting due to the presence of the Virgin\u2019s feet, whereas in the drawing Barocci explores the area underneath the child\u2019s pelvis in full.

Below right, Barocci with very thin lines of red chalk sketched the Virgin\u2019s mantle above her naked breast. This section concerned him as he had to transform his study of a male model into a female figure in the painting. As a result, it has been suggested that the green mantle was developed in order to help him obtain the correct proportions. \u00a9 Photo Scala, Florence - courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit\u00e0 Culturali (2643x3528px)" ] },

While Barocci had quite clearly decided on the pointing of the index finger, he is evidently struggling with the positioning of the other fingers.

The Virgin is suckling the Child and Saint Joseph looks on from the right.\nNG 29 may be the picture painted, according to Bellori (1672), for Count Antonio Brancaleoni, who lived near Perugia. The design was engraved in reverse in 1577 by Cornelius Cort and the painting probably dates from about 1575. Numerous drawings made in preparation for NG 29 are known; a highly finished drawing made by Barocci in preparation for the engraving and formerly in the National Gallery is now in the British Museum.\nThe window and the bench in the background seem to be based on windows in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino.
