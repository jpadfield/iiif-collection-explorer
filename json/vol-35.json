The generous support of the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies of British Art has made the project possible. Other Benefactors of the Wallace Collection have significantly contributed towards it. <br\/><br\/>Although the National Gallery possesses fewer paintings by Reynolds in its permanent collection \u2013 five in all  \u2013  these span an interesting and representative period of the painter\u2019s career, from Captain Robert Orme (NG681) of 1756 to Lord Heathfield of Gibraltar (NG111), not exhibited until 1788. Further technical study of these pictures has taken place in order to integrate and compare the results of examination and analysis of the National Gallery pictures with the data acquired for the Wallace Collection paintings, which cover an equally long  time span, 1759\u201388, in Reynolds\u2019s career. <br\/><br\/>As in all survey studies of the work of one painter, the results are inevitably enriched and deepened the more examples that are included in the total, so we believe that this collaborative programme of research, the results of which are recorded fully in this Bulletin, will be of particular value to all those concerned with understanding (and preserving) the work of Sir Joshua Reynolds and his imperfect but spectacular techniques of painting.<br\/><br\/>Ashok Roy<br\/> Editor; National Gallery Technical Bulletin<\/td><td style='width:200px;font-size:0.8em;'><img src='http:\/\/research.ng-london.org.uk\/fcgi-bin\/iipsrvIntPublic.fcgi?FIF=\/pics\/pyramids\/websiteimages\/Website_Collection_Online\/Web Zoom Images\/WZ web NG Fronts\/N-2077-00-000045-WZ-PYR.tif&amp;SDS=0,90&amp;CNT=1.0&amp;WID=200&amp;QLT=75&amp;CVT=jpeg' alt='Image N-2077-00-000045-WZ' style='border:1px solid #ffc600;margin: 0px; cursor: default;'><br\/>NG2077: Sir Joshua Reynolds, Lady Cockburn and her Three Eldest Sons, 1773, Canvas, (141.5 x 113 cm)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><li><b>Links to other websites:<\/b> Some additional images which are referred to in the Technical Bulletin can be viewed by following the links below.<\/li><li class='resList'><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britishmuseum.org\/collection\/object\/P_1840-0808-130\">Thomas Watson, after Joshua Reynolds, The Strawberry Girl, 1774.
