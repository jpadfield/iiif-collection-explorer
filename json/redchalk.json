Here he has masterly studied it in red chalk. In addition, he also uses this sheet to study Saint John the Baptist\u2019s arm with the squiggle representing the goldfinch in his hand. Below right, Barocci with very thin lines of red chalk sketched the Virgin\u2019s mantle above her naked breast. This section concerned him as he had to transform his study of a male model into a female figure in the painting. As a result, it has been suggested that the green mantle was developed in order to help him obtain the correct proportions. \u00a9 Photo Scala, Florence - courtesy of the Ministero per i Beni e le Attivit\u00e0 Culturali (2643x3528px)" ] },

The Virgin is suckling the Child and Saint Joseph looks on from the right.\nNG 29 may be the picture painted, according to Bellori (1672), for Count Antonio Brancaleoni, who lived near Perugia. The design was engraved in reverse in 1577 by Cornelius Cort and the painting probably dates from about 1575. Numerous drawings made in preparation for NG 29 are known; a highly finished drawing made by Barocci in preparation for the engraving and formerly in the National Gallery is now in the British Museum.\nThe window and the bench in the background seem to be based on windows in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino.
