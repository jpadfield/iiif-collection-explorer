Here he has masterly studied it in red chalk. In addition, he also uses this sheet to study Saint John the Baptist\u2019s arm with the squiggle representing the goldfinch in his hand. Below right, Barocci with very thin lines of red chalk sketched the Virgin\u2019s mantle above her naked breast. This section concerned him as he had to transform his study of a male model into a female figure in the painting.

Barocci used three colours of chalk to convey the depth and warmth of the painting, which remained in the Marches.
