      "label": { "en": [ "NG29: Federico Barocci, The Madonna of the Cat ('La Madonna del Gatto'), probably about 1575, Oil on canvas, (112.7 x 92.7 cm) The young John the Baptist holds a goldfinch, a bird frequently kept as a pet but also a traditional symbol of Christ's Passion; the Baptist is teasing the cat shown in the left foreground by holding the bird above his head. The Virgin is suckling the Child and Saint Joseph looks on from the right.\nNG 29 may be the picture painted, according to Bellori (1672), for Count Antonio Brancaleoni, who lived near Perugia. The design was engraved in reverse in 1577 by Cornelius Cort and the painting probably dates from about 1575. Numerous drawings made in preparation for NG 29 are known; a highly finished drawing made by Barocci in preparation for the engraving and formerly in the National Gallery is now in the British Museum.\nThe window and the bench in the background seem to be based on windows in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino. There are several copies and workshop versions of the picture.\nCesarei collection, Perugia, by 1784; acquired in Italy by Buchanan, about 1805; collection of Revd Holwell Carr, 1807; by whom bequeathed, 1831.\nGould 1975, pp. 11-12\nEmiliani 1985, I, pp. 93-103 Bequeathed by Revd Holwell Carr, 1831 (6000x4929px)" ] },
