The face is less idealized than the one shown in the drawing from the Royal Library, Windsor (R41), suggesting that it was done from life. Also, if one compares this study with the Virgin\u2019s youthful head in the final composition, the head in the sketch seems to belong to a slightly older woman.

It is probable that Barocci remodelled it from one of his previous head studies at a very late stage in the compositional process. The face is created using a light outline in black chalk, then the design is reinforced with various coloured chalks. Finally, Barocci uses black and red chalk once again for the background and the curls of hair.

In this study, Barocci is not as interested in the depiction of the skin or of the woman\u2019s facial features as he is in other head studies. His concern here lies instead in defining the woman\u2019s hair. He alternates thin lines of black chalk with smudged brown pastel to render the depiction of the hair as natural as possible.

The Virgin is suckling the Child and Saint Joseph looks on from the right.\nNG 29 may be the picture painted, according to Bellori (1672), for Count Antonio Brancaleoni, who lived near Perugia. The design was engraved in reverse in 1577 by Cornelius Cort and the painting probably dates from about 1575. Numerous drawings made in preparation for NG 29 are known; a highly finished drawing made by Barocci in preparation for the engraving and formerly in the National Gallery is now in the British Museum.\nThe window and the bench in the background seem to be based on windows in the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino. There are several copies and workshop versions of the picture.\nCesarei collection, Perugia, by 1784; acquired in Italy by Buchanan, about 1805; collection of Revd Holwell Carr, 1807; by whom bequeathed, 1831.\nGould 1975, pp. 11-12\nEmiliani 1985, I, pp. 93-103 Bequeathed by Revd Holwell Carr, 1831 (6000x4929px)" ] },
