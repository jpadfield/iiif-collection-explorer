With the exception of a number of rather impressive landscape and architectural drawings, Barocci\u2019s works on paper are all preparatory for his paintings.<br\/><br\/>The selection presented here comprises all the surviving drawings related to Barocci\u2019s only picture in the National Gallery, \u2018The Madonna of the Cat (\u2018La Madonna del Gatto\u2019)\u2019, NG29.  They are divided into types of drawings (according to the Italian tradition), supports, media, drawings certainly related to the painting and others which are close to it, but not necessarily connected. Through this extensive series of preparatory sheets we can reconstruct exactly how Barocci\u2019s design evolved from conception to completion. More widely they also provide valuable information about the practice of drawing in Italy.<br\/><br\/><font-size: 80%>Virginia Napoleone, McCrindle Curatorial Assistant, The National Gallery<br\/>August 2013<\/font><br\/><br\/><\/td><td style='width:200px;font-size:0.8em;padding:10px 30px 0px 20px'><img src='http:\/\/research.ng-london.org.uk\/fcgi-bin\/iipsrvIntPublic.fcgi?FIF=\/pics\/pyramids\/websiteimages\/Website_Collection_Online\/Web Zoom Images\/WZ web NG Fronts\/N-0029-00-000064-WZ-PYR.tif&amp;SDS=0,90&amp;CNT=1.0&amp;WID=200&amp;QLT=75&amp;CVT=jpeg' alt='Image N-0029-00-000064-WZ' style='border:1px solid #ffc600;margin: 0px; cursor: default;'><br\/>NG29: Federico Barocci, The Madonna of the Cat ('La Madonna del Gatto'), probably about 1575, Oil on canvas, (112.7 x 92.7 cm)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan='2'><h2>Thanks<\/h2>This project was made possible by The Joseph F.
