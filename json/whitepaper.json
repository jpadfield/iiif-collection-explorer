It is clear that Barocci placed the figures along two diagonals. The first, from top right to bottom left, formed by the Virgin and Child, and the second, in the opposite direction with Saint John the Baptist and the sleeping Saint Joseph. The pose in the latter resembles that found in a drawing at the Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe degli Uffizi, Florence (R31.1), with the exception that here it is drawn on the left-hand side.
