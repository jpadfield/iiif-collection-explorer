# IIIF Collection Explorer
A demonstration of a alternative way of presenting and exploring IIIF Collections. It works by automatically converting the information stored in the IIIF Collections into more user friendly webpages and the images listed within the IIIF Manifests are presented directly with the IIIF compliant viewer Mirador.

Please note the code included in the "dist" folder is related to [Mirador](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador) project and their code is released under a [separate licence](https://github.com/ProjectMirador/mirador/blob/master/LICENSE).
