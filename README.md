# iiif-collection-explorer
A demonstration of a alternative way of presenting and exploring IIIF Collections. It works by automatically converting the information stored in the IIIF Collections into more user friendly webpages and the images listed within the IIIF Manifests are presented directly with the IIIF compliant viewer Mirador.
